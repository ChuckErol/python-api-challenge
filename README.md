# Python Api Challenge

## WeatherPy:
    - After creating a "api_keys.py" file I added my api key to the file 
    - Generated ramdom cities using citipy
    - Used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated
    - Created dataframe and saved output as csv to output_data folder
    - Created scatter plots to compare two verialables bwtween these cities and analyzed the linear relationships
    - Saved some of the plots to output_data folder

## VacationPy:
    - Added my api key to "api_keys.py" file
    - Using the cities collected in WeatherPy, creatad a map_plot to visualize them on map
    - After filtering and droping null values created a dataframe with ideal weather conditions
    - Added "Hotel Name" column and created new dataframe wiht only specific columns from previous dataframe
    - For each city, I used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates
    - Using map_plot displayed the hotel locations and information on a map.

## Github
    - Created a ".gitignore" file
    - Added "api.keys.py" and "DS.Store" files so my api keys won't get uploaded when I push my files

## Sources:
    - I found some of my codes from prevoius class activities.
    - I ask some questions to my classmates in Slack and during our study group meeting.
    - I found some heplful information watching varius YouTube videos
    - I found information from OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify API documentation sections
